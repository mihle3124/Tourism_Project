## Overview  
    
An exploration of New York City short term rentals and prospects for real investing on behalf of interested  
Hoteliers.  
  
Three Questions are addressed:
  
&nbsp; Has New York City rental housing recovered from Covid?  
  
&nbsp; How will the recent NYC ban on short term rentals affect the availability of short term rentals?  
  
&nbsp; Where should a prospective Hotelier invest to best take advantage of a drop in short term rentals?
  
## Background  
  
### The NYC Ban  
  
On September 5th 2023, New York began enforcing a ban on short-term rentals. Stays that are less than 30 days.

- Register with the city  
- Display a valid registration on their listing.    
- Host must share their data with the city  
&nbsp; - Host Info: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Profile ID, Profile URL, Total Amount the platform transmitted   
&nbsp; to host, account name.  
&nbsp; - For the listing: Address, Listing Name, ID number, URL, Type of place, total number of nights booked.  
- Hotels must also comply.  
- No more than two paying guests at a time    
- Guest must have free and unobstructed access to all rooms and exits.
- Internal doors cannot have key locks that allow guests to leave and lock their room behind them.
