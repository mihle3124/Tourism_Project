## Overview  
    
An exploration of New York City short term rentals and prospects for real estate investing on behalf of interested  
Hoteliers.  
  
&nbsp; Three Questions are addressed:
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Has New York City rental housing recovered from Covid?
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; How will the recent NYC ban on short term rentals affect the availability of short term rentals?  
  
&nbsp; &nbsp; Where should a prospective Hotelier invest to best take advantage of a drop in short term rentals?
  
## Background  
  
### &nbsp; The NYC Ban  
  
&nbsp; On September 5th 2023, New York began enforcing a ban on short-term rentals. Stays that are less than 30 days.   
  
&nbsp; In order to legally comply and operate, hosts who wish to have short term rentals must:  
&nbsp; - Register with the city  
&nbsp; - Display a valid registration on their listing.    
&nbsp; - Host must share their data with the city  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Host Info: Name, Address, Phone Number, Email, Profile ID, Profile URL, Total Amount the platform transmitted   
&nbsp; &nbsp; to host, account name.  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - For the listing: Address, Listing Name, ID number, URL, Type of place, total number of nights booked.  
&nbsp; - Hotels must also comply.  
&nbsp; - No more than two paying guests at a time    
&nbsp; - Guest must have free and unobstructed access to all rooms and exits.
&nbsp; - Internal doors cannot have key locks that allow guests to leave and  
&nbsp; lock their room behind them.

&nbsp; The effects of the Covid Pandemic on New York rental real estate is assumed to have first taken place in 2020.

&nbsp; &nbsp; - Yearly comparison of Seasonality to measure the Ban effect  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Listings before/after Ban binned by Minimum Nights  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Compliance with the Ban one month after the start of enforcement  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ban Effect on overall listings in the 5 Boroughs  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Pricing and Review ratings across Boroughs  
&nbsp; &nbsp; - Correlation between Price and a Guests "Location" Rating

## Conclusion  
  
The hole left from Covid and the NYC Ban is sizable and presents a great opportunity to invest in the short term  
rental market.
  
&nbsp; Next Steps  
  
&nbsp; - Validate Initial Findings by way of ground level research through sampling and usage of paid data  
&nbsp; sources, focused on targeted neighborhoods.
  
&nbsp; - Creation of a formal business case, which can then be converted into a formal business plan.
